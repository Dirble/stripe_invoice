= StripeInvoice

StripeInvoice makes it easy for you to show invoices/receipts to the customers of your [Koudoku](https://github.com/andrewculver/koudoku/)-based Rails application. 
It downloads the last 100 invoices via the Stripe API, stores them in a table in the database and renders a basic 
invoice template. 

StripeInvoice is opinionated on which gems your application uses. 

Requirements: 

1. [Koudoku](https://github.com/andrewculver/koudoku/) to handle subscriptions
2. [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for user authentication

## Usage

```

```


To setup your application run the following commands from the command line:
